## ðŸ“‹ Announcements
- [2025.03.20] The remaining code and checkpoint files will be updated soon. We appreciate your understanding and patience in the meantime!



## 1. Install Packages

All experiments in this paper were conducted using CUDA 11 on a single NVIDIA A6000 GPU, which necessitates at least 48GB of video memory to run successfully.

```
pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1 --extra-index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu113
pip install transformers==4.31.0
pip install numpy==1.23.2
pip install pandas==1.5.3
pip install -U scikit-learn
pip install scikit-multilearn==0.2.0
pip install scipy==1.12
pip install gensim
```


## 2. Download Dataset

Please download MIMIC-III dataset from [official PhysioNet link](https://physionet.org/content/mimiciii/1.4/), unzip it, and place the required files as indicated.

This repository includes both the ```ccs_multi_dx_tool_2015.csv``` and ```ccs_single_dx_tool_2015.csv``` files. Detailed information regarding these files is available in the CCS Users Guide, which can be accessed [here](https://hcup-us.ahrq.gov/toolssoftware/ccs/CCSUsersGuide.pdf).
